This is a project for the Odin project

It's a 5-round game of rock-paper-scissors, with random IA moves. 

I decided to do it with a different theme, based on the first Pok√©mon game.

This was the first practice with DOM manipulation, CSS flexbox and grid and a briefly introduction into CSS transitions.

I also practiced with setTimeOut() to smooth some transitions from js.
